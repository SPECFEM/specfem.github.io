# SPECFEM

The SPECFEM codes use the spectral-element method to simulate seismic wave propagation on different scales. Together with dedicated inversion tools, they constitute an ecosystem in computational seismology to address diverse topics related to seismic tomography and ground-shaking hazard analysis.
